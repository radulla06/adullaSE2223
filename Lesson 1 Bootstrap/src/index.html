                        <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadLeft">One major problem that farmers face is crop disease. Lacking a way to quickly diagnose diseases, many farmers suffer from reduced crop yields, which can impact the food supply chain. Machine learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, provide one potential solution to this issue. The engineering goal of this project was to create an artificial intelligence model using a Convolutional Neural Network that, when given an image of a plant leaf, can quickly determine what type of disease the plant has with greater than 80% accuracy. The constraints were that the model would be trained in under five hours and take less than ten seconds to return its prediction once an image is inputted to it. The model was tested to see if any overfitting or underfitting occurred. The model consisted of one convolutional layer, one max pooling layer, and six fully-connected layers, and 30 epochs were used during the training. After training the model, 12 images from each of the 33 disease groups were tested against it to gather testing data. An inferential statistics test comparing the loss of the training and validation datasets per epoch of model training showed that no underfitting or overfitting occurred. The accuracy of the model was evaluated in two ways. First, the model was evaluated against the evaluation data which had 91.28% accuracy. Second, the testing data was analyzed and the accuracy was determined to be 90.40%. Thus, the created model successfully reached the engineering goal of 80% accuracy.</p>

                        <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadRight">One large problem that farmers face affecting their crop production is plant disease. Any diseased plants can not be sent to retailers and must be thrown out, causing loss to the farmers. In fact, in the United States, plant diseases cause about $20 billion dollars in crop losses each year. They also affect over 40% of the six most important crops.</p>
                        <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadRight">Current common methods of plant disease detection are largely based on laboratory procedures. These procedures often take a long time to complete, and are not efficient enough for farmers, who often need to make decisions about their crops quickly. Lacking a quick way to diagnose plant diseases, farmers may incur heavy crop losses, which can also affect consumers, who might not have enough food to purchase.</p>

                        <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadLeft">Research Practicum is a course students at High Technology High School take in their sophomore year. In the course, students build upon their work in the freshman year's Introduction to Research course and actually conduct the experiment they began. The teachers act as mentors to the students, guiding them as they complete their research. Students are requierd to both submit a paper summarizing their work throughout the course and a video where they present their findings using a slideshow. Afterwards, students are given the option to participate in various science fairs using these research projects, where they compete against projects made by other students in their age group.</p>
